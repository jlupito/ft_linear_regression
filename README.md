# ft_linear_regression

The project consists in the implementation of a simple linear regression with a single feature - in this case, the
mileage of the car.

• The first program 'predict.py' will be used to predict the price of a car for a given mileage.
When launched, it prompts for a mileage, and then gives the estimated price for that mileage. 

• The second program 'linear_regression.py' is used to train the model. It reads the dataset file
and performs a linear regression on the data.
Once the linear regression has completed, theta0 and theta1 are saved for use in the first program.
